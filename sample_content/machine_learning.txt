# Machine Learning Basics

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence where computers learn from data without being explicitly programmed.

## Neural Networks
A neural network is composed of layers of nodes, called neurons.
- **Input Layer**: Receives raw data.
- **Hidden Layers**: Process information using weights and biases.
- **Output Layer**: Produces the final prediction.

## Backpropagation
Backpropagation is the algorithm used to train neural networks. It calculates the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights.
It uses the chain rule to propagate error backwards from output to input.

## Overfitting
Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including noise, and fails to generalize to new data.
Regularization techniques like Dropout and L2 Regularization help prevent this.
