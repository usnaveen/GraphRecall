# Photosynthesis

Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to synthesize foods with the help of chlorophyll pigments.

## The Process
6CO2 + 6H2O + Light Energy -> C6H12O6 + 6O2

It mainly takes place in the chloroplasts.

## Light-Dependent Reactions
- Occur in the thylakoid membranes.
- Convert light energy into chemical energy (ATP and NADPH).
- Water is split (photolysis), releasing Oxygen.

## Calvin Cycle (Light-Independent)
- Occurs in the stroma.
- Uses ATP and NADPH to convert CO2 into glucose.
- Requires the enzyme RuBisCO.
